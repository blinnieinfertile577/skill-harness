# specgraph-skills

Embedded pack for [specgraph](https://github.com/45ck/agent-docs) (`@45ck/agent-docs`) day-to-day workflow.

Included skills:

- `annotation-writer` — Add `@spec`/`@implements` JSDoc annotations to source files to produce E0 evidence
- `evidence-gap-review` — Analyse `specgraph verify` output and produce a prioritised action list
- `spec-writer` — Write spec documents with correct YAML frontmatter and evidence requirements
- `verify-interpreter` — Interpret `specgraph verify` output and recommend next steps
- `waiver-writer` — Write justified evidence waivers with expiry and approval fields

## Prerequisites

specgraph must be installed in the project:

```bash
npm install @45ck/agent-docs
```

Or bootstrap an entire project (installs specgraph, Beads, noslop, git hooks):

```bash
./skill-harness setup-project --dir ./my-project
```

The binary is available as both `specgraph` and `agent-docs`.

Config file lives at `.specgraph/config.json` (falls back to `.agent-docs/config.json` for legacy projects).

## Installation

### Via skill-harness

```bash
./skill-harness install --packs specgraph-skills --packs-only
```

### Manual

```bash
cp -r packs/specgraph-skills/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```
